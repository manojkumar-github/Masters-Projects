We built a set of baseline classifiers using lexical,
structural, emotive and psychological features extracted
from Twitter posts. We then improved on the baseline classifiers
by building an ensemble classifier using the Rotation
Forest algorithm and a Maximum Probability voting classification
decision method, based on the outcome of base
classifiers. 

1) They used human annotators to annotate the text taken from the web source from media and blog posts.
2) Then applied tf-idf (term frequency Inverse Document Frequency) method to the corpus to identify frequently in suicidal identifcation class but less frequently in non-suiciadal identification class.
3) For tf-idf he considered n-grams of 1 to 5 upto top 500 ranked words. Further down to 62 keywords after peer reviews.
4) 3 types of feature sets and used PCA for feature reduction.
5) Using fast text each of the sentence embeddings for each phrases are computed
